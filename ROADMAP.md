# Mind Map Application Roadmap - Offline-First Edition

This document outlines future features to achieve parity with professional mind mapping tools like MindView 9, with a focus on offline-first, local storage architecture. All features are designed to work without a centralized database, storing data locally and enabling peer-to-peer sharing.

## Priority 1: Quick Wins - Local First (1-2 weeks each)

### 1.1 Quick Entry Mode
- **What**: Type continuously, hit Enter for siblings, Tab for children
- **Why**: Fastest way to capture ideas without mouse
- **Implementation**: Keyboard event handler that creates nodes based on context
- **Storage**: All nodes saved to IndexedDB immediately

### 1.2 Multiple Layout Algorithms
- **What**: Top-down, left-right, org chart layouts
- **Why**: Different content needs different visualization
- **Implementation**: Layout engine with pluggable algorithms

### 1.3 Auto-layout Optimization
- **What**: Automatically balance and position nodes
- **Why**: Reduces manual positioning work
- **Implementation**: Force-directed graph algorithms
- **Offline**: All layout calculations run client-side

## Priority 2: Rich Content (2-3 weeks each)

### 2.1 Images and Icons in Nodes
- **What**: Embed images, emoji, or icon libraries
- **Why**: Visual memory aids and categorization
- **Implementation**: Extend Node component with image rendering

### 2.2 File Attachments
- **What**: Attach documents to nodes
- **Why**: Keep related materials together
- **Implementation**: Store files as base64 in IndexedDB or use File System API
- **Sharing**: Include attachments in export or use WebRTC for P2P transfer

### 2.3 Extended Node Content
- **What**: Notes, descriptions, metadata
- **Why**: Nodes as information containers
- **Implementation**: Expandable detail panel

## Priority 3: Professional Features (3-4 weeks each)

### 3.1 Multiple Views
- **What**: Gantt chart, timeline, outline views
- **Why**: Same data, different perspectives
- **Implementation**: Separate view components sharing data model

### 3.2 Export Capabilities (All Client-Side)
- **What**: Word, PowerPoint, PDF, HTML5
- **Why**: Integration with existing workflows
- **Implementation**: 
  - PDF: jsPDF (client-side)
  - Office: Open XML format generation in browser
  - HTML5: Self-contained interactive viewer
  - Share links: Compressed data in URL
- **✅ Already Implemented**: Interactive HTML5 export with embedded viewer

### 3.3 Themes and Styling
- **What**: Professional templates, custom themes
- **Why**: Professional appearance without design skills
- **Implementation**: Theme engine with CSS variables

## Priority 4: Collaboration (4-6 weeks)

### 4.1 Real-time Collaboration (P2P)
- **What**: Multiple users editing simultaneously
- **Why**: Team brainstorming and planning
- **Implementation**: 
  - WebRTC for peer-to-peer connections
  - CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) for sync
  - No central server required
  - Optional: Use PeerJS or similar for connection brokering

### 4.2 Comments and Annotations
- **What**: Threaded discussions on nodes
- **Why**: Asynchronous collaboration
- **Implementation**: Comment model and UI overlay

### 4.3 Change Tracking
- **What**: Version history and rollback
- **Why**: Safety and accountability
- **Implementation**: 
  - Store all changes in IndexedDB with timestamps
  - Git-like branching stored locally
  - Export/import version history
  - Diff visualization

## Priority 5: Advanced Features

### 5.1 Task Management
- **What**: Due dates, assignments, progress tracking
- **Why**: Project management within mind maps
- **Implementation**: Extend node model with task properties

### 5.2 Presentation Mode
- **What**: Navigate mind map as slides
- **Why**: Direct brainstorm-to-presentation workflow
- **Implementation**: Presentation engine with transitions

### 5.3 Mobile Support
- **What**: Touch-optimized responsive design
- **Why**: Capture ideas anywhere
- **Implementation**: 
  - PWA with offline support
  - Service Worker for full offline functionality
  - Local storage sync when online
  - Install as app on mobile devices

### 5.4 AI Integration
- **What**: Auto-suggest nodes, summarization
- **Why**: Augmented brainstorming
- **Implementation**: 
  - Client-side AI with WebLLM or ONNX
  - Optional cloud AI with user consent
  - All processing can work offline
  - Privacy-first approach

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Virtual rendering for large maps (1000+ nodes)
- Web Workers for layout calculations
- IndexedDB as primary storage (not just cache)
- OPFS (Origin Private File System) for large attachments

### Offline-First Architecture
- **Primary Storage**: IndexedDB for all mind maps and nodes
- **Sync Strategy**: Optional cloud backup, not required
- **Sharing**: 
  - Method 1: Compressed URLs (✅ implemented)
  - Method 2: HTML export (✅ implemented)
  - Method 3: JSON files (✅ implemented)
  - Method 4: WebRTC direct transfer
  - Method 5: QR codes for mobile
- **Deployment**: Static hosting only (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)

### Data Ownership
- Users own all their data
- Export everything at any time
- No vendor lock-in
- Optional encrypted cloud backup

### Architecture
- Plugin system for extensibility
- Modular view components
- State management scaling (consider Redux)

### Data Model Extensions
```typescript
interface EnhancedNode {
  // Current properties...
  
  // Rich content
  images?: string[]
  attachments?: Attachment[]
  notes?: string
  hyperlinks?: string[]
  
  // Task properties
  dueDate?: Date
  assignee?: string
  priority?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
  progress?: number
  
  // Styling
  icon?: string
  shape?: 'rectangle' | 'oval' | 'hexagon'
  theme?: string
}
```

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Offline-First Development**: Every feature works without internet
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Online features are optional extras
3. **Local-First Storage**: IndexedDB before any cloud consideration
4. **Privacy by Design**: No telemetry without explicit consent
5. **Performance First**: Everything runs on the client

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Local Development (Current)
- Users run their own instance
- Full PostgreSQL for development
- All data stored locally

### Phase 2: Static Deployment
- Deploy frontend to CDN (Vercel/Netlify)
- Each user has their own IndexedDB
- No backend required
- Share via URLs, files, or P2P

### Phase 3: Optional Services
- Optional cloud backup service
- Optional collaboration broker (WebRTC signaling)
- Optional AI enhancement API
- All opt-in, never required

## Success Metrics

- Quick entry mode: 50% faster node creation
