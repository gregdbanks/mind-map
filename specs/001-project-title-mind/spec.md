# Feature Specification: PixiJS Canvas Migration for Mind Map Performance

**Feature Branch**: `001-project-title-mind`  
**Created**: 2025-09-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Perfect before we add exams or exam questions, I wanted to work on performance optimizations. SpecKit is just an open-source plan and task generator. Help me describe the PixiJS migration to solve performance issues"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Extract: performance optimization need, PixiJS migration requirement
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: performance issues with current canvas, PixiJS as solution, mind map visualization
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark performance targets, migration scope, feature preservation
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Define user experience expectations during/after migration
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Focus on performance improvements and feature parity
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Canvas elements, nodes, connections, interactions
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Ensure all performance criteria are measurable
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a mind map user, I want to work with large, complex mind maps without experiencing lag or stuttering during interactions, so that I can efficiently organize and visualize my ideas regardless of the number of nodes or connections.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a mind map with 500+ nodes and 1000+ connections, **When** I pan across the canvas, **Then** the movement is smooth with no visible stuttering (60 FPS maintained)
2. **Given** a mind map with 100 nodes, **When** I drag multiple selected nodes simultaneously, **Then** the dragging animation remains responsive with no input lag
3. **Given** any mind map, **When** I zoom in/out using scroll wheel or controls, **Then** the zoom transition is smooth and immediate
4. **Given** a large mind map, **When** I double-click to create a new node, **Then** the node appears instantly without delay
5. **Given** any mind map view, **When** I use keyboard shortcuts (space for pan, delete, etc.), **Then** the response is immediate with no perceptible delay

### Edge Cases
- What happens when mind map contains 5000+ nodes?
- How does system handle rapid pan/zoom combinations?
- What is the experience on lower-end devices?
- How are animations affected during bulk operations (importing large JSON)?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain all existing mind map functionality after migration (create, edit, delete nodes, connections, pan, zoom)
- **FR-002**: System MUST render canvas at [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target frame rate not specified - 30 FPS minimum? 60 FPS target?]
- **FR-003**: System MUST support smooth panning with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum node count not specified - 1000 nodes? 10,000 nodes?]
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to interact with nodes (click, drag, edit) with response time under [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable latency not specified - 16ms? 33ms?]
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve all visual styling (colors, text, connections, shadows, selection states)
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain keyboard shortcut responsiveness regardless of canvas complexity
- **FR-007**: System MUST support all existing export/import formats (JSON, PNG) with identical output
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve touch/mouse interaction behaviors exactly as current implementation
- **FR-009**: System MUST scale performance linearly with node count up to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: upper limit not specified]
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain text rendering quality at all zoom levels

### Key Entities
- **Canvas**: The main drawing surface containing all visual elements, supporting pan/zoom transformations
- **Node**: Individual thought/concept boxes with text, position, colors, and connection points
- **Connection**: Visual lines linking parent-child nodes showing relationships
- **Selection**: Visual indicator showing which nodes are currently selected for operations
- **Viewport**: The visible portion of the canvas, determining what needs to be rendered
